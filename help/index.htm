<h1>Belvedere Automated File Manager</h1>
<p>Belvedere is an automated file managment application that performs actions on files based on user-defined criteria. For example, if a file in your downloads folder hasn't been opened in 4 weeks and it's larger than 10MB, you can tell Belvedere to automatically send it to the Recycle Bin.
