<h1>Folders Tab</h1>
<p>The Folders Tab is the main working area of the application.  Here the users assign rules to the specific folders that they have selected.</p>
<p>The tab is divided into two main sections, the left half where the folders are selected, and the right, where the rules for the selected folder are displayed.</p>

<a name="folders"><h2>Folder List</h2></a>
<p>This list shows the folders that have been added to Belvedere to monitor with the rules displayed on the right side.</p>
<img src="images/tab-folders-1.JPG">
<p>The buttons to the left of the folder list allow the user to set the order in which folders, and their rules, are processed.  Folder processing occurs from the top, down.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> '/\' Button </strong> - Will move the selected folder up one position in the displayed list.</li>
<li><strong> '\/' button </strong> - Will move the selected folder down one position in the displayed list.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following buttons are available below the folder list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> '+' Button </strong>- To add a folder, click the '+' button at the bottom of the screen, and select the folder from the dialog box.</li>
<ul><li>NOTE:  Folders may also be added by dragging and dropping a file or folder to the above list box as well.  The parent directory in each case will be the folder that is added.</li></ul>
<li><strong> '-' Button </strong>- To remove a folder, click the '-' button, and confirm your deletion of the folder.  If you delete a folder with rules, the rules will be removed as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>To display the rules assigned to a particular folder, left click to highlight the folder, and the assigned rules will be displayed in the right side of the application.  The full path of the selected folder will also be displayed over the rules list.</p>

<a name="rules"><h2>Rule List</h2></a>
<p>This list shows the rules for the folder selected in the left side of the screen and displayed immediately above.  Here you can see the name of the rule, and if the rule is currently enabled or not.  If a rule is listed as 'Yes' in the 'Enabled' column, the rules will be applied to all files within the specified folder.  If the rule is listed as 'No' in the 'Enabled' column, this particular rule will be skipped over during processing.</p>
